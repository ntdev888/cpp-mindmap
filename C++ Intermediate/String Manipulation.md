**String Manipulation in C++ Overview:**

String manipulation in C++ involves various operations for modifying, extracting, and processing strings. The Standard Template Library (STL) provides a rich set of functions and methods for working with C++ strings (`std::string`). Here's an overview of common string manipulation operations:

**String Concatenation:**
- Concatenating strings involves combining two or more strings into a single string.
- This can be achieved using the `+` operator or the `append()` or `+=` methods.

**Example - String Concatenation:**
```cpp
std::string firstName = "John";
std::string lastName = "Doe";
std::string fullName = firstName + " " + lastName;
```

**Substring Extraction:**
- Substring extraction is the process of obtaining a portion of a string.
- You can use the `substr()` method to extract a substring from a string.

**Example - Substring Extraction:**
```cpp
std::string sentence = "C++ is powerful and flexible.";
std::string sub = sentence.substr(0, 3); // Extract "C++"
```

**String Searching:**
- String searching allows you to find the position of a substring within a string.
- You can use the `find()` method to locate the first occurrence of a substring.

**Example - String Searching:**
```cpp
std::string text = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.";
size_t position = text.find("fox"); // Find the position of "fox"
```

**String Replacement:**
- String replacement lets you replace one substring with another.
- You can use the `replace()` method to perform string replacement.

**Example - String Replacement:**
```cpp
std::string sentence = "C++ is powerful and flexible.";
sentence.replace(9, 8, "awesome"); // Replace "powerful" with "awesome"
```

**String Splitting:**
- String splitting is the process of breaking a string into smaller parts based on a delimiter (e.g., a space or a comma).
- You can use functions like `getline()` with an input stream to split strings.

**Example - String Splitting:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <sstream>

std::string data = "apple,banana,cherry";
std::istringstream ss(data);
std::string token;

while (std::getline(ss, token, ',')) {
    std::cout << token << std::endl;
}
```

**String Transformation:**
- String transformation includes operations like converting a string to uppercase or lowercase.
- You can use functions like `toupper()` and `tolower()` to change the case of characters.

**Example - String Transformation:**
```cpp
std::string text = "Hello, World!";
for (char &c : text) {
    c = std::tolower(c); // Convert characters to lowercase
}
```

**String Formatting:**
- String formatting involves creating formatted strings with placeholders for values.
- The `printf`-style formatting can be achieved using the `sprintf()` function or modern C++ methods like `std::to_string()` and string concatenation.

**Example - String Formatting:**
```cpp
int num = 42;
std::string formatted = "The answer is " + std::to_string(num);
```

String manipulation is a fundamental part of C++ programming, especially when working with text data. The STL provides a powerful set of tools to simplify string operations, making it easier to process, modify, and work with strings in your C++ applications.
