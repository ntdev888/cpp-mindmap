Arithmetic operators in C++ are symbols used to perform basic mathematical operations on numerical values. They include addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and more. Here's a brief overview along with examples:

1. **Addition `+`:** Adds two values together.

   Example:
   ```cpp
   int sum = 5 + 3; // sum is now 8
   ```

2. **Subtraction `-`:** Subtracts the second value from the first.

   Example:
   ```cpp
   int difference = 10 - 4; // difference is now 6
   ```

3. **Multiplication `*`:** Multiplies two values.

   Example:
   ```cpp
   int product = 6 * 7; // product is now 42
   ```

4. **Division `/`:** Divides the first value by the second.

   Example:
   ```cpp
   float quotient = 15.0 / 4.0; // quotient is now 3.75
   ```

5. **Modulus `%`:** Computes the remainder of the division of the first value by the second.

   Example:
   ```cpp
   int remainder = 17 % 5; // remainder is 2
   ```

6. **Increment `++`:** Increases a variable's value by 1.

   Example:
   ```cpp
   int num = 5;
   num++; // num is now 6
   ```

7. **Decrement `--`:** Decreases a variable's value by 1.

   Example:
   ```cpp
   int num = 8;
   num--; // num is now 7
   ```

8. **Assignment `=`:** Assigns a value to a variable.

   Example:
   ```cpp
   int x = 10; // x is assigned the value 10
   ```

These operators are fundamental for performing mathematical operations in C++ programs. They can be used with variables and constants to calculate values, manipulate data, and control program flow.
